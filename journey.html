				<h1>Web Languages I Want to Learn </h1>
				<p>
					<em>HTML</em>Although Ive learned a decent bit of HTML I'd like to know more. Mainly to have the ability to use it more proficiently and effeciently. There are still things in HTML thatIi have trouble with and need to improve and things I probably don't know how to do.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>css</em>I've worked a bit with css but I'm still not all that good with it. Learning more css can help make more proffesional looking sites and help me keep organized. So learning more will definitely help me make better websites. Mainly I'm looking to get better at coding styles for the entire page or making different boxes for text and images.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Javascript</em>Using javascript in the little amount i have in this class has made me want to learn more of it and how to properly use it. Seeing that i can do more than just HTML by itself when put into the code for a website is amazing and the elements it can make are cool. This is what makes me want to learn more about it and to effectively use it in my websites.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Java</em>Java itsef is very interesting to me as it's what has been used for multiple games that I've played in the past. This makes me curious on how to program using java. I have no experience with java so its a completely foriegn language to me but I've wanted to learn it for a decent amount of time.
