						<h3>Jedds Tree Care</h3>
						<p>
							This assignment was when messing with styles and putting in some unique elements really started. This had me learning about changing colors in css, messing with images, and even embedding a Youtube video into the website. Changing the colors of the website even had me taking an image into photoshop just to make every color match.

						<h3>Favorite Recipe Page</h3>
						<p>
							This was a rather basic assignment but it was one of my favorites to actually do. This assignment taught me how too use tables and fill them in completely. This was also the project where I learned to play with the background making it an image that I found.

						<h3>Carpage</h3>
						<p>
							This website was the first one I've ever made. Though it isn't impressive it was the start of HTML for me and at the time I was happy with myself for making. The coding was simple only using text, images, centering the whole thing, and no css at all.
