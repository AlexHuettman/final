				<em>What is Smite?</em>Smite at its core is a MOBA, or a multiplayer online battle arena, and currently sitting as my favorite game. The base concept is a 5 on 5 game battle in three lanes with a jungle area in between. The lane you play in generally depends on the type of character you play as. Dou lane, the left lane generally has a gaurdian and a hunter. The solo lane is usually occupied by a warrior. The mid lane is controlled by a mage and the jungle is controlled by an assassin.
			<p>
				<em>Why do I play it over other MOBAs?</em> Stradegy games sit as my favorite type of game. The reason Smite sits as my favorite is because it seems faster than other MOBAs and most abilities in the game have to be aimed unlike other MOBAs. All of the characters are also characters from so many different mythologies and I love mythology.

			<p>
				<em>My favorite part of Smite</em> My personal favorite part is playing as hunters or assassins. these classes sit as some of the hardest to play as they require high accuracy to pull off all of your damage unlike the big area of the mage class.
