				<p>
					Welcome to my webpage. You'll see some of what I've learned, what I've made, and a little bit about myself.
				</p>
				<p>
					This class has been a lot of fun for me and this website wouldn't be made if i didn't have the help of this class. So the things I've learned is probably the most important thing here.

			<h2><span>The ablility to create websites has become the main way I show my work.</span></h2>
			<p>
				This website has everything really needed to know about my time in this class. You can find information on the things that I've learned and the websites I've created with it. The different web languages that I've learned and web languages that I want to learn in the future. There's some information about Github, which is the main source of online publication of my websites. And some random stuff like my favorite game.
