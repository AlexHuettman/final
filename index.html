			<h1>The Things I've Learned in this class
			</h1>
			<p>
				<em>Basic Coding through HTML</em> This class has taught me quite a bit about coding through HTML. I've used it in a previous class but only once and this class has put me out of my comfort zone when using it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>CSS</em> Using css became necessary including on this website. It has also became very useful since you don't have to put every style element inside the tags for your paragraphs and such. It also allows for one style to be easily applied to multiple elements in the website itself making for a convenient and organized system.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Javascript</em> Though Javascript wasn't used all that much and i still have little experience with it, the elements and effects you can make with it are cool. The ability to make alert boxes or scrolling text is always cool and adds some interesting stuff to a website and intrigues me to learn more.
